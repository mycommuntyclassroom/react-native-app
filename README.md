An app created with React Native

---

### Getting Started

Cliffnotes for official [React Native Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html):


- `brew install node`
- `brew install watchman`
- `npm install -g react-native-cli`


**Run iOS App**

`npm run ios`


**Run Android App**

`npm run android`

* Note: you can only run one app at a time.

**Hung up on 'Loading dependency graph, done'?**
### Apply the following:
in terminal in root of the project:
`react-native upgrade - it generates 'IOS' and 'Android' folders again` *hit N(o) for everything*
`react-native link`
`react-native run-ios`

**Debugger**
